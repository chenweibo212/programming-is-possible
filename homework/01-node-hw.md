This is a text adventure realized entirely as a Node Express app.

## Handing it in
Again the only part of this assignment that must be handed in is the writing assignment. Again, about 500 words should be enough. For this assignment, you can either (1) create a git repository and check the writing in as a .txt or a .md file, or you can (2) email me the assignment at st2774@nyu.edu. This is the one and only time that email will be a valid way to turn in an assignment!

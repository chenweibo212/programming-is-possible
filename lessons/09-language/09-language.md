## Essential Questions
- How does natural language differ from other languages?
- What kinds of techniques can computers use to recover information from natural language?
- What kinds of data structures represent the information in natural language?
- What are ways that we can play with a computer's understanding of language?
- How do people use NLP for beneficial and not-so-beneficial ends?

## Introduction
Language allows us to encode statements about the world in a way that can be communicated to other entities that share our language. Some languages, like programming languages, have a rigid syntax and encode discrete mechanistic operations. Others, like most human languages, encode meaning more loosely. Interpreting the language is an active process that involves a large number of internalized rules and associations, accumulated over a human lifetime. A major challenge for software developers has been to break down natural language in way that computers can extract information from it, without requiring that the computer have a full, human-like intelligence.

Natural Language Processing refers to a suite of tools for understanding, formatting, and generating language. In this class, we'll survey some of those tools, and see how we can put them to creative use. We'll see the kinds of information that computers can get from natural language, including sentiment, parts-of-speech, and topics. We'll also experiment with generating language for some procedural poetry writing. Overall students should come away with a better understanding of what's possible with NLP, some fun things you can do with it, and maybe a sense of what NLP means for society in general.

### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
This module is part of DM-GY 6063, _Programming is the Art of the Possible_. This is a second semester creative coding course, designed for students who have a strong JavaScript foundation.

### Outcomes & Goals
* In this workshop we will look at different libraries for Natural Language Processing. We'll see how to analyze and generate language using these libraries.
* Students should come away knowing more about how NLP works. They should understand the approaches that different libraries take for extracting information from language, as well as what assumptions those libraries make.
* Students should also get a sense of how NLP is being used in a broader social context.

### Pacing / Duration
TBD

## Materials Needed
TBD but certainly Node.

### Exercises To Do Before Class
TBD. Maybe some reading about esoteric data, sentiment analysis and hedge funds.

### Vocabulary (example)
* Language - Any communicable system for encoding and decoding information (wow improve this definition please)
* Machine Language - Language expressing the serial operation of computer hardware. Maps in a deterministic way to hardware operations and machine states.
* Natural Language - Language as human beings use it. Continually evolving and constantly reinterpreted (work on this definition).
* Sentiment - The emotional valence of a language sample.
* Bag of Words - A histogram representation of language, counting words
* Syntax - The grammar structure of language
* Semantics - The meaning structure of language

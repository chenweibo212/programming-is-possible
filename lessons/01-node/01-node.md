## Essential Questions
- What is Node.js?
- What is npm?
- What is Express.js?
- What is git?

## Introduction
In this class we're going to start diving into Node.js. We're using Node and not Python or some other scripting language mostly for the sake of simplicity. However, the stuff we'll talk about in this class and throughout the course extends to other languages as well. In the second half of this class, after the midterm assignment, you never have to use JavaScript again if you don't want to. 

We'll talk about how to run a Node program, how to create a Node package, how to set up a simple server with Node, and how to push the whole thing up to github. In future classes we'll drill down into each of these areas a little more closely.

### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
Before this class you should have Node installed, preferrably with nvm. On OS X you'll also want to have Developer Tools installed. Windows users should install Git Bash with MinGW. You might also want a coding text editor installed. Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code are both excellent.

### Outcomes & Goals
* In this class we'll create a Node project. The project will use Express.js to implement a simple HTTP server. Finally, we'll upload the whole thing to GitHub.
* Students will come away from this class with a basic understanding of how Node works. We'll also look at writing a web server, user agents, and debugging a Node program.

### Pacing / Duration
- 0:15 Discussing the assigned reading
- 0:10 What is Node used for? What is a web server? Why should we care?
- 0:10 Finding our way around the command line, mkdir, rm, cd, ls
- Using `git init` to create a repository.
- Making git commits, making a branch, merging a branch
- Creating a JavaScript script to run with Node, and running that script.
- Writing a script that prints out information about the operating system to the screen.
- Using NPM to set up a Node package
- Parts of a node package
- Installing a dependency (chance)
- Using `require` to link the dependency
- Running the script
- Creating an HTTP server with Node
- Using an NPM script to run the server (also what is JSON?)
- Break
- Debugging a Node program
- Installing Express.js
- Parts of a URL
- Express routes
- Returning a simple webpage
- Workshop: Make a website that tells the user about themselves.
    - What kind of computer are they using?
    - Where are they visiting from?
    - How many times have they visited?
    - What other websites have they visited?
    - Get each other's IP addresses and visit each other's websites
    - Upload the whole thing to GitHub

## Materials Needed
You'll need a computer with a connection to the internet. Node, nvm, and git should be installed. OS X users should install Developer Tools, Windows users should install MinGW. It's also highly recommended that you install Chrome.

### Exercises To Do Before Class
You might want to read an intro to Node, and definitely brush up on your JavaScript if it's new to you.

### Vocabulary (example)
* Node:
* JavaScript:
* Express:
* Debugging: 

## Exercise Descriptions
Descriptions of each exercise or phase of class. Similar to pacing but with more description of steps.

## Student Reflections, Takeaways & Next Steps
Additional materials for the students to leave with that can help them dig deeper into the subject or additional exercises and challenges to help students progress their knowledge to the next level and gain mastery of the subject through independent study.

* Multiple Project Exit Points: an idea of high-medium-low projects so students are locked into one end product.
  * First Steps - a simple exercise
  * Next Steps - medium exercise
  * Big Steps - a challenge or open ended study
* Presentation: how might students share their work? With peers, outside world? What media or platforms could/should be referenced to students to encourage sharing (Instagram, Tumblr...)? 
* Reflection: reflection questions that ask students to think about CS concepts and practices. How can students express what theyâ€™ve learned in some creative way?

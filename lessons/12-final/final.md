## Essential Questions
- How does hardware and software fit into a creative project?
- What libraries are interesting to you?
- How much can really be accomplished in two weeks?
- How will you work together?

## Introduction
Oh my oh my how the last few weeks have just flown by. Here we are at the end. Take a breath, you've earned it. Now it's time for us to start working on our final project. The goal here is to challenge yourself, and to bring all of the knowledge and experience you've gained throughout this course to bear on something concrete. Think about what you'd like to say, what techniques you'd like to investigate, and how you're going to accomplish something complete in the short time you have.

### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
This capstone assignment is part of DM-GY 6063, _Programming is the Art of the Possible_. This is a second semester creative coding course, designed for students who have a strong JavaScript foundation.

### Outcomes & Goals
* In this final project, students will be working with a partner or a small group to build a software and/or hardware system, containing multiple interlinking parts, that connects to some of the themes we've been exploring in this class.
* One major goal is to give students the chance to dive deeper into a particular subject or technique that interests them.
* It's also intended that students come away with solid documentation that they can use to share the project.
* Finally this project encourages students to work together as a team, leveraging each other's skills.

### Pacing / Duration
TBD. Honestly this is something that I'd like to write in class, where we talk about what's necessary to get a project like this done.

### Exercises To Do Before Class
TBD

## Project Description
Descriptions of each exercise or phase of class. Similar to pacing but with more description of steps.

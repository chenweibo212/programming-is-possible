## Essential Questions
- What does "client-side" mean?
- What is the difference between server-side and client-side rendering?
- How can we deliver a whole application to the client?
- What is webpack?
- What is React?

## Introduction
The Internet has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Maybe you've noticed. One huge change has been to the complexity, scale, and sophistication of applications that we can deliver on the client side. Many websites these days are implemented as a single-page app. Clicking between the different parts of such a website, the user isn't navigating between pages as much as they are loading different parts of a single application. Building a website like this isn't necessarily difficult, but it helps to have familiarity with a few popular front end frameworks. We'll be working with React and Webpack, but other comparable tools like Vue and Browserify are also totally valid.

### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
This module is part of DM-GY 6063, _Programming is the Art of the Possible_. This is a second semester creative coding course, designed for students who have a strong JavaScript foundation.

### Outcomes & Goals
This can be easily answered by completing these example sentences:
* In this workshop we will be… (soldering, setting up a RPi home network, making a wearable that communicates with….)
* Students will walk away with a deeper understanding of…

### Pacing / Duration
TBD

## Materials Needed
You'll need a laptop and a connection to the Internet. Node should be installed. We'll be using the following Node libraries:
- Express
- React
- Webpack
- Babel

### Exercises To Do Before Class
TBD. Maybe something about React? But also maybe not? Maybe that cool essay about assistive technology.

### Vocabulary (example)
* Front-end - 
* Single-page web application - 
* Bundling - 
* Transpiling - 
* Properties - 
* State -

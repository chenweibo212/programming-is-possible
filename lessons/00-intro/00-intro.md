## Essential Questions
- What is a protocol? An interface? An encoding?
- Where do these show up in our everyday lives?
- Why is it important to learn to program?

## Introduction
In this introductory class, we'll spend a little time getting to know each other, as well as discussing what this course is all about. There will be an exercise to prime our understanding of the major course themes of interface and representation.

### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
This course is intended for students at the undergraduate or graduate level who have completed an introduction to programming. The primary programming environment used in this course is Node, so familiarity with JavaScript or a C-like programming language is a big positive. However, the course will draw on a wide skillset, so proficiency in another language or environment is helpful.

### Outcomes & Goals
* A major goal of this course is to teach students how to manage larger software projects. We will be using Node.js, but we will learn skills that translate to any language or environment.
* A subtheme for this course is cybernetics and management between and among human and machine entities.
* Students will walk away with real-world skills like hosting a project on GitHub, making pull requests, organizing tickets, writing documentation, and working with a development team.
* Students will also learn to think critically about information systems, and will learn to recognize and exploit software interfaces.

### Pacing / Duration
Number of total hours the unit will take in a typical workshop session(s). Please try to take into account transition time between instruction and hands on exercises if any prep is necessary.

- Break down of the class schedule example: 
  - :15 Overview, context, examples and vocabulary 
  - :20 Instruction & hands on exercise 
  - :15 Wrap-up discussion & sharing, reflection or journal and next steps

## Materials Needed
What hardware, software, or other materials will students or teachers need for lessons.

### Exercises To Do Before Class
Nothing for this class, it's the intro

### Vocabulary (example)
* Interface: 
* Protocol:
* Encoding: 

## Exercise Descriptions

- 0:10 - Welcome to class, introductions
- 0:20 - Discussion, how do groups of people work together? How does a building get built? Ways of working on planning a wedding, but also a school project, but also teams at Apple, Google, and Amazon.
- 0:20 - Discussion, what makes a program good? Is it terse? Elegant? Efficient? Why do we write math formulae, but then also remember common-sense interpretations? If the formulae are hard to understand, why do we bother with them in the first place? Is a computer program a math formula or an essay? When we write a computer program, who are we writing it for?
- 0:05 - Quick break
- 0:20 - Discussion, what is a protocol? An encoding? An interface? What is the Kyoto protocol? What is the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol? What is an API? How can you use an API subversively? What is an API for? If you order 50 pizzas to your friends house as a prank, does that make you a hacker?
- 0:20 - Discussion, how do people write programs? What's scrum? Product management?
- 0:05 - Quick break
- 0:50 - Exercise, making ourselves into a protocol. Can we set up a protocol right here in class? Divide into two teams. Each team divides into two groups. Group A gets a prompt for something to draw. They can only communicate with group B by showing them one of three cards: a triangle, a circle, and a square. The goal is to get group B to draw the prompt as accurately as possible. Group B has one card that they can use to communicate back. You have 15 minutes to work out how you're going to do it.
- 0:20 - Let's talk about the methods that each group came up with. What parts were an encoding? A protocol? An interface? How did you deal with the fact that you had to express something complex using a very limited alphabet? What was the biggest strength of your particular choice. The biggest drawback? What shared assumptions did you and the drawing group have, that made the task easier or harder?
- Whatever's left - Let's talk about what you need to do to get set up for the next class.

## Student Reflections, Takeaways
Additional materials for the students to leave with that can help them dig deeper into the subject or additional exercises and challenges to help students progress their knowledge to the next level and gain mastery of the subject through independent study.

* Multiple Project Exit Points: an idea of high-medium-low projects so students are locked into one end product.
  * First Steps - a simple exercise
  * Next Steps - medium exercise
  * Big Steps - a challenge or open ended study
* Presentation: how might students share their work? With peers, outside world? What media or platforms could/should be referenced to students to encourage sharing (Instagram, Tumblr...)? 
* Reflection: reflection questions that ask students to think about CS concepts and practices. How can students express what theyâ€™ve learned in some creative way?

## Post Session aka Homework
Make sure that you come to the next class with Node, NPM and Git installed on your machine (see installation instructions). Make sure you have an account on github. If you hate github for some moral or philosophical reason, talk to me and we'll figure out how to use some other host.

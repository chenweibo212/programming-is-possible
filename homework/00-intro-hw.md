# Homework 00

## Due Date

This assignment follows the first lesson, [00-intro](../lessons/00-intro/00-intro.md). It must be turned in by midnight, February 4. 

## Description

### Reading
- Yegge, Steve _Stevey's Google Platforms Rant_ https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611
- Fed, Leonardo _The Single Most Important Internal Email in the History of Amazon_ https://www.sametab.com/blog/frameworks-for-remote-working
- Pereiro, Federico _How I write backends_ https://github.com/fpereiro/backendlore

Take your time with the first two, thinking about what we talked about in class. Notice how choices about how to organize people affect how software and hardware gets organized. For _each_ of these, come up with 1 Question, 1 Comment and 1 Quote. These will not be collected, but I will ask for them at the beginning of class.

The last of these three is very technical, and I don't expect you to read and understand it all. Rather, run your eyeballs over it, mull it around in your head, and linger a while longer on the diagrams. I want you to think about systems with multiple parts. Think about some of the concepts we talked about in class, like points of failure and redundancy. You don't need a QCQ for this one, just think about it.

Please don't do all of this reading at the last minute. I mean, I can't stop you, but it won't be as interesting or as fun if you don't give yourself time to think about it.

### Writing
In addition to the reading assignment this week, there will be a brief writing assignment. Simply, pick a program that you worked with, or a software library that you've used. Answer one simple question: is it a good program? Think about the kinds of things we talked about in class. Does it work? Does the structure of the program feel natural, or does it force you to think in distracting ways. Is the program actively maintained? What about the culture around the program? Is the community of users supportive or dismissive?

You don't have to write much, something on the order of 500 words should be plenty. For this assignment, you can either (1) create a git repository and check the writing in as a .txt or a .md file, or you can (2) email me the assignment at st2774@nyu.edu. This is the one and only time that email will be a valid way to turn in an assignment!

### Extra Reading

If you're relatively unfamiliar with Node, Git, or JavaScript itself, I recommend brushing up before coming to class on Wednesday. 

#### Git

- https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/

#### Node
- https://medium.com/@jesterxl/introduction-bde654b5670e (don't worry so much about all the specific libraries, but _do_ think about they do)

#### JavaScript

## Handing it in
Again the only part of this assignment that must be handed in is the writing assignment. Again, about 500 words should be enough. For this assignment, you can either (1) create a git repository and check the writing in as a .txt or a .md file, or you can (2) email me the assignment at st2774@nyu.edu. This is the one and only time that email will be a valid way to turn in an assignment!

## Essential Questions
- What is a Raspberry Pi?
- How can a Raspberry Pi interface with the outside word?
- How can we connect sensors + motors to our Raspberry Pi?

## Introduction
In this class we'll look at how to start up a Raspberry Pi, how to run code on it, and how to use sensors and actuators with our Pi. Finally, we'll see how to upload that code to the internet, using a custom server.

Over the last decade or so, the Raspberry Pi has becomen increasingly recognizable and ubiquitous. It's small, low-cost and extremely powerful. For less than $100, we can install a general purpose computer that can also gather data from the outside world using hardware sensors. When people talk about the Internet of Things, they're talking about the kind of ubiquitous computing that hardware like Raspberry Pi makes possible.

### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
This module is part of DM-GY 6063, _Programming is the Art of the Possible_. This is a second semester creative coding course, designed for students who have a strong JavaScript foundation.

### Outcomes & Goals
* In this class we'll be using a Raspberry Pi. That means writing code that will run on a Pi, and determining that the code is operating as expected. We will also see how to gather sensor data from a Raspberry Pi, and how to connect to the internet and upload that data.
* Students will come away understanding the basics of how to get up and running with a Raspberry Pi, and how to turn one into a data gathering device.

### Pacing / Duration
TBD

## Materials Needed
Well a Raspberry Pi obviously. Having a GPIO hat might be nice too.

### Exercises To Do Before Class
TBD, but maybe something about Raspberry Pi, and also about ubiquitous computing.

### Vocabulary (example)
* Embedded - 
* Raspberry Pi -
* Internet of Things -
* Ubiquitous Computing -
* Sensor -
* Hat -
* GPIO -

## Essential Questions
- What is Machine Learning? How is it similar to/different from human learning?
- How is Machine Learning different from other statistical techniques?
- What kinds of problems can be solved with Machine Learning?
- What are some challenges facing Machine Learning?

## Introduction
By now everyone has some familiarity with Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It's the fuel for technological fantasies like self-driving cars and self aware computers, and for technological anxieties about disappearing jobs and authoritarian governments. One class is hardly enough time to cover all the complexities of working with and living with AI, but we'll cover as much as we can.

In this class, we'll develop a deeper understanding of how Artifical Intelligence works, especially the Deep Network architectures that have revolutionized the field in recent years. We'll contrast AI with other machine learning techniques, and we'll see how some libraries make it easier to work with AI.

### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
This module is part of DM-GY 6063, _Programming is the Art of the Possible_. This is a second semester creative coding course, designed for students who have a strong JavaScript foundation.

### Outcomes & Goals
* In this workshop, we will be talking about AI and exploring some libraries for working with AI in software.
* Students will walk away with a deeper understanding of how AI works and what they can do with it.

### Pacing / Duration
TBD

## Materials Needed
Still in flux, but as a point of departure:
- Software
    - ml.5
    - TensorFlow
    - Runway.ai

### Exercises To Do Before Class
Maybe installing some tools for TensorFlow? I hope no one has to install CUDA. If someone has to install CUDA it's a bad sign.

### Vocabulary (example)
* Machine Learning - Any algorithm by which a system can change its behavior in response to data
* Artificial Intelligence - Machine learning systems that appear to exhibit intelligence. This includes properties like adapting to new data, separating salient features from noise, and generalizing to new and unfamiliar problems.
* Deep Neural Net - Neural nets incorporating many layers. These nets require much more training data than shallower nets and take longer to train, but they can do some pretty amazing things.
* Training - Presenting a ML system with data, so that it will change its internal configuration in some way. This can be supervised or unsupervised. Generally a ML system attempts to minimize error, perhaps with a heuristic that optimizes for simplicity.
* Generalization - Understanding a broad class of problems from some subset of the problem set.
* Overfitting - A machine learning system is overfit if it performs well for a small set of examples but fails to generalize.
* Topology - The graph structure of a neural network. How many nodes are in each layer, how are the nodes connected. Connections can be sparse, dense, recurrent or not.
